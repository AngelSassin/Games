This is my simulation of Pac-Man. The purpose of the project was to make the game as similar, mechanically, to the actual game from the ghosts' individual AI to different level specifications. 

The executable .jar file does not read the tile images well, so it is necessary to run the Start_Pacman.bat file instead. This will launch the game with the graphics.

Enjoy! Updates will come later!
